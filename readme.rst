Introduction
============

This code was made to read out the data exposed by an Eastron SDM630 (but probably also others) energy meter. It
consists of 2 parts:

* ``dump_all.py`` simply dumps all known registers for human inspection
* ``read_influx.py`` reads some chosen registers, and ingests them to my InfluxDB


Sample output
=============

Example output on a 3-phase delta (i.e. 3 wires, no neutral) configuration::

Installation
============

No installation is required, but some python modules need to be present. It is recommended to use virtualenv::

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
